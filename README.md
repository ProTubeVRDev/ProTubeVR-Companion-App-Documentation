## Advanced Mode
  Basically, switching between modes allows the user to **enable/disable advanced features**.
  
## Connected devices
This is the page you land on when you start the app. By default, you will see each connected device here.

![home](https://github.com/ProTubeVRDev/Client-Doc/assets/62568994/d695324b-e130-49b1-8453-ee16b4a1853f)

## Advanced Connected Devices
In advanced mode, you now have a `Channels` button appearing under each device. <br/>
Clicking on this button will pop a menu where you can manually **assign channels** to your device <br/> 
<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/ProTubeVRDev/Client-Doc/assets/62568994/1f8e81de-8b7a-45e3-80a7-81d03dfeb1f6" width="250"/>
  <img src="https://github.com/ProTubeVRDev/Client-Doc/assets/62568994/7222e17b-c740-41d2-9dd6-3b1a426ffa1f" width="700"/>
</div>
<br/>

**Important Notes :** <br/>
 - Without assigning any channels, connecting a new device will assign one automatically in this particular order : <br/>
 `RifleButt - RifleBolt - Pistol1 - Pistol2 - Other - Vest` <br/>
 - If you connect more devices than the total channel number available, auto-assign will loop back to RifleButt and so on

<br/>

## SteamVR Compatibility
